This is a small practice project to impliment both Tries and the LZW compression algorithm for use in another project


Trie & LZW 


**IMPORTANT: This implementation does not support unicode characters only ascii characters ranging from 0-127 is gauranteed; characters past 127 are platform dependent and thus some unicode characters may or may not be part of the initial LZW table **


--------------------------------

This will be an improved version of the Trie Tree and LZW compression using binary to avoid issues with unicode
